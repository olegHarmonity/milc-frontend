/**
 * README
 *
 * All translations are minimum 2-level nested. Do NOT place translation directly into root object.
 * All commonly used translations place in "common".
 * All button translations put under "button" object.
 * All form label translations put under "label" object.
 * Organize translations into GROUPS, that can be per feature, function or similar.
 *
 * First level objects keep in ALPHABETIC order with exception of "common".
 *
 * Do NOT name translations too long.
 *  Bad: afterAcceptYouWillRecieveEmailLink
 *  Good: successTextEmail, even better - nest it register: { successTextEmail: "" }
 *
 * Use variables/formatting and other features of the plugin.
 *
 * Read docs: https://kazupon.github.io/vue-i18n/guide/formatting.html
